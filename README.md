# ML_AlgorithmUI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3. Client side consuming API related to Machine learning algorithms.It gives better chart representation of ML algorithms parameter for better vsualization. THe server side of this code written in python by using Flask framework in [Server side code](https://github.com/Aksh-kumar/PYTHONMLAPI). Right now It contain only Expectation 
maximization algorithm details and provides facility to cluster your data by using this algorithms and allow to see all the essential parameters of this algorithms on web. 

A pre trained model is already been saved in server side. but It can work with different data as well. see readme file in PYTHONMLAPI for mode details.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
